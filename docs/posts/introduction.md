# Introduction

I am a Developer Advocate at Google and I work with machine learning and data
science tools. Here, I'll be posting tips and information about various data
science and machine learning tools in [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/).

In the near future, I'll be posting about developer tools related to
[Conversational AI](https://cloud.google.com/conversational-ai), including
things like [Dialogflow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow) and
[Contact Center AI (CCAI)](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/contact-center).

Next up, I'll be posting more about what I'm doing with
[Terraform and Dialogflow](https://github.com/koverholt/dialogflow-cx-terraform),
stay tuned!
