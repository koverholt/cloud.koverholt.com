# Intro

I am a Developer Advocate at Google and I work with machine learning and
scalable data science in [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/).

Here, I'll be posting tips and information about various data science and
machine learning tools in Google Cloud.

In the near future, I'll be posting about developer tools related to
[Conversational AI](https://cloud.google.com/conversational-ai), including
things like Dialogflow and Contact Center AI (CCAI).

Soon, I'll be posting more about what I'm doing with
[Terraform and Dialogflow](https://github.com/koverholt/dialogflow-cx-terraform),
stay tuned!
